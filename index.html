                                                            people died and around 5 lakh individuals got harmed because of road accident every

                                                            The analysis demonstrates that during the most recent ten years, road accidental
                                                            fatalities in India have expanded at the rate of 5% every year while the country's

                                                            of road accident varies on the basis of age, gender, month and time. Among individuals

                                                            get killed and 10,000 get harmed because of road accidents. In india, there is one death
                                                            every four minute due to traffic accident. Quick urbanization, motorization, absence of
                                                            appropriate road design, poor awareness levels, nonexistent damage anticipation
                                                            projects, and poor implementation of traffic laws has exacerbated the circumstance.
                                                            Also one of the major reasons of these accidents is drunken driving.<br>
                                                            So as to improve road conduct of individuals and advance road well being as an order,
                                                            the Government of India as of late executed the recently presented Motor Vehicle
                                                            (Amendment) Act, 2019, which happened from September 1. With amendments in more
                                                            than 63 clauses, the government appears to be good to go to actualize some severe
                                                            punishments in probably the most common traffic violations. According to industry
                                                            specialists, the new law is being viewed as a much-expected activity to teach an instant
                                                            awareness of others expectations among the citizens. It is additionally accepted that
                                                            with due usage of the new law, the wide gap among uninsured and protected vehicles
                                                            will limit significantly. Not long after the new traffic laws came into effect, we have
                                                            noticed a few instances where drivers are paying strong fines all across the nation. This
                                                            is because the new Motor Vehicles Act has improved the fines for different driving
                                                            mistakes normally made by individuals, both deliberately and inadvertently. Over all, the
                                                            government has improved fines for offenses where no punishment was actualized.
                                                            From September 1, new fines have been recommended for carrying of excess travelers,
                                                            inability to use seat strap and violation of principles in seating of kids, violation of
                                                            security measures drivers and pillion riders, refusal to stop and submit vehicle for
                                                            weighing, uses of phones in quiet zones and inability to all free passes to emergency
                                                            
                                                            vehicles. The fines for practically all first offense has been enhanced from up to Rs 100
                                                            to Rs 500 and the punishment for second/ensuing offense has been enhanced from 300
                                                            to Rs 1,500. Aside from this, few new penalties have additionally been added incase of
                                                            violation of road regulations.<br>
                                                            As per the new Motor Vehicles Act 2019 law, the punishment on driving a vehicle
                                                            without a legitimate motor insurance has been expanded to Rs 2,000 from Rs 1,000 for
                                                            the first offense and for a subsequent offense, the fine is Rs 4,000. Aside from the fine,
                                                            there is a probability of being imprisoned for 3 months on both these events. A 100%
                                                            expansion in the punishment for driving without a legitimate driving permit is significantly
                                                            on the grounds that according to the GIC report, in India there are more than 19 crore
                                                            enrolled vehicles out of which just 8.26 crore are insured. This is a grave issue as
                                                            during an accident by an uninsured vehicle the victim has no other option than
                                                            requesting remuneration from the government instead of the insurance company.
                                                            According to me, I can't say that the increment of traffic rules violation fines is bad move
                                                            by the government because the peoples life is more important. I hope due to this

                                                            <b> Aspects of social construction of technology</b><br>
                                                            The social construction of technology(SCOT) is a theory within the field of science and
technology studies. The social construction of technology is one methodology among a few
constructivist methods for contemplating science and innovation that rose during the 1980s.
The term 'social construction of technology' can be utilized to indicate two distinct things.
First, it is an exploration way to deal with concentrate specialized change in the public eye,
both in recorded and in contemporaneous investigations. Second, it is a hypothesis about the

connection between society and innovation. The investigate of mechanical determinism and
the rise of the hypothesis of the social construction of technology started and picked up force
during the 1980s alongside different exercises adding to the advancement of another field of
concentrate once in a while marked science and innovation studies (STS) and different
occasions science, technology, and society (likewise STS). Inside this field of study, two
hypothetical methodologies are regularly recognized. the rendition of social constructivism
alluded to as SCOT and actor-network theory (ANT). The two hypotheses look to clarify why
and how specific advancements are received while others are rejected or never created. Both
SCOT and ANT are worried about how innovative structures are embraced and become
installed in social practices and social foundations.<br>
ANT takes as its unit of investigation the frameworks of conduct and social practices that are
entwined with material items. This is the system part of the actor-network theory. The
on-screen character some portion of ANT stresses the nearness of numerous entertainers,
human and nonhuman. For example, nature assumes a significant job in figuring out which
innovations come to be received, and nature can be portrayed as one of the entertainers in
forming the advances that prevail with regards to getting to be implanted in the social world.
Advances and ancient rarities can themselves additionally be on-screen characters. People,
nature, and antiques all in all are alluded to in actor-network theory as actants.<br><br>
<b>New media in terms of Lev Manovich</b><br>
New media speaks to an intermingling of two separate histories. It is an intermingling of
media innovations and digital computing. Notice that this intermingling includes two
particular advances. Media portrayals are made an interpretation of from analog to a digital
code. This transforms them into numerical information which can be exposed to all activities
which PCs are competent off. There are two separate thoughts at work here- computerized
code and computation. New media includes two particular thoughts, that of the computerized
and that of computation. It alludes to two unmistakable thoughts: numerical (discrete)
portrayal and a PC (a gadget for calculation). The two don't infer one another; for example,
simple PCs can work over consistent information. Be that as it may, since computerized
media actually regularly is utilized related to PCs, the two thoughts progressed toward
becoming conflated. In any case, the arrangement of characteristics which we credit to
advanced media is mixed, alluding to both the possibility of computerized coding and to the
possibility of computation. In any case, the possibility of an advanced without anyone else
can scarcely isolate new media from the old. What is basic isn't that media is essentially
converted into a digital code however that through this interpretation it winds up subject to
computation. In perspective on this, the expression "computerized media" which ended up
famous during the 1990s is appalling, since it just reflects one thought - that of digitization. A
superior term would be "PC media" or, surprisingly better, "programmable media. Out of
these four principles, the principle of variability perhaps is the most intriguing. From one

viewpoint, such mainstream new media shapes as spreading type intuitiveness and
hypermedia can be viewed as specific occurrences of variability principle. Then again, this
principle shows how the adjustments in media advancements are firmly tied up with changes
in the social association. Similarly, as the rationale of old media compared to the rationale of
mechanical mass society, the rationale of the new media fits the rationale of the post-modern
culture of individual variability. In modern mass society everyone should appreciate similar
merchandise - and to have similar convictions. This was additionally the rationale of media
innovation. A media object was gathered in a media manufacturing plant, (for example, a
Hollywood studio). A great many indistinguishable duplicates were delivered from an ace
and conveyed to every one of the residents. Broadcasting, film dissemination, print advances
all pursued this rationale.<br><br>
<b>Economy of New Media</b><br>
It is expanding hard to separate any real logical classification that isolates "retailers, for
example, Amazon eBay and Apple from "web search tools" like Google or Bing or
"web-based life, for example, Facebook what's more, Twitter or even organized
administrations, for example, Uber or on the other hand AirBnB. Almost these organizations
incorporate highlights for looking substance; for sparing profiles; for suggesting, rating, and
remarking on substance; for contributing substance; for stamping different profiles or content
as favoured and for finding and gathering groups of onlookers and focusing on them with
substance. Clearly, the scale, degree, and accentuation of these highlights is in each case is
extraordinary, yet it's anything but a stretch to contend that they all speak to examples of a
comparative marvel. They are, all things considered, merchants who try not to make content
however who get and redistribute it, and who pitch access to and data about the individuals
who read, compose, play, purchase and associate utilizing their administrations, while in the
meantime pulling in those individuals by giving them devices to discover their way in an
ocean of substance, items, and individuals.<br>
There are a few things that I will tell how media influencing the economy.<br>
<b>1. The democratization of information-</b><br>
Prior to social media, we needed to pay to get out information about our business. Presently,

every individual and company has its very own media image - and there are altogether fewer
hindrances to contacting individuals.<br>
Before cell phones and social selection, it was considerably more troublesome (and costly) to
contact individuals, particularly if our area wasn't on a fundamental road. A couple of private
companies isn't sufficient to stress a major brand, yet a huge number of them around the
nation can make a genuine scratch in their piece of the pie.<br>
<b>2. Platform economy</b><br>
As writing on multi-sided and two-sided markets includes created inside the field of financial

aspects, often utilizing media organizations as models, media researchers have additionally
been endeavoring to think about what the "platformisation" of media may mean for issues of
content decent variety, security, opportunity of articulation, and the connection among free

and paid work. Online life is profoundly connected to a progression of stages (Facebook,
LinkedIn, YouTube, and so on.)that control distribution. They are the pipes that permit (or
doesn't permit) substance to spread. This has upset the conventional promoting model, and
these stages have turned into a portion of the world's greatest organizations by market
capitalization subsequently. Facebook and Google, for instance, control practically 60% of
every online media spending now.<br><br>
<b>E-governance & its model</b><br>
Electronic governance or e-governance is the utilization of information and communication
technology (ICT) for conveying taxpayer driven organizations, trade of information,
communication exchanges, reconciliation of different stand-alone frameworks and
administrations between government-to-client (G2C), government-to-business (G2B).<br>
Well, in short, we can say that E-governance is only an administration that goes about as a
mode of trade of information, exchanges, and administrations.<br>
Advantages of E-governance:<br>
1. Speed – Technology makes communication speedier. Web, Phones, Cell Phones
have decreased the time taken in ordinary communication.<br>
2. Cost Reduction – Most of the Government use is appropriated towards the expense
of stationary. Paper-based communication needs heaps of stationery, printers, PCs, and so
forth which calls for nonstop overwhelming consumption. Web and Phones make
communication less expensive sparing significant cash for the Government.<br>
3. Transparency – Use of ICT influences administering to pronounce straightforward.
All the information of the Government would be made accessible on the web. The residents
can see the information at whatever point they need to see. In any case, this is just
conceivable when each snippet of information of the Government is transferred on the web
and is accessible for people in general to examine. The current overseeing process leaves
numerous approaches to disguise the information from every one of the general population.
ICT helps make the information accessible web-based disposing of the considerable number
of potential outcomes of covering information.<br>
4. Accountability – Once the administering procedure is made straightforward the
Government is naturally made responsible. Accountability is answerability of the
Government to the general population. It is the answerability for the deeds of the
Government. A responsible Government is a dependable Government.<br><br>
<b>Cyber Activism</b><br>
Cyberactivism is the way toward utilizing Internet-based mingling and communication
systems to make, work and oversee activism of any sort. It enables any individual or

association to use informal communities and other online innovations to reach and
accumulate supporters, communicate messages and advancement a reason or development.
Cyberactivism is otherwise called Internet activism, online activism, advanced activism,
web-based sorting out, electronic support, e-crusading, and e-activism. Cyberactivism's
essential working rule is like standard physical activism- to start a native based development
toward a particular objective, cause or target. Cyberactivism utilizes person to person
communication apparatuses and stages to share and communicate adages and messages, and
to interface with netizens. These stages incorporate Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube
and other prevalent and specialty interpersonal organizations, alongside email, texting (IM)
and other online coordinated effort devices.<br>
Contingent upon the reason or need of the e-activist, cyberactivism can be utilized for
different purposes, for example, mindfulness creation, assembling and sorting out devotees
and starting responses. For instance, e-activists use petitions carefully marked by various
adherents before they are sent to government and administrative specialists.<br><br>
<b>postmodernism</b><br>
Clearly, the term postmodernism assumes a time that went before modernism. It reflects the
term modern. it was the inclination to respond against innovation (portrayed by Utopian
beliefs/standards) by showing a mentality of suspicion, dismissal of clear limits for an
increasingly blended methodology.<br>
The job of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as an apparatus for
improvement has pulled in the continued consideration of the United Nations over late years.
Vital associations have been created with givers, the private division and common society,
and working gatherings and teams have been built up to upgrade interagency coordinated
effort all through the Joined Nations framework. ICT contributes extensively to rearranging
social guidelines for cooperation, offering new channels for building up and getting to
associations and connections. All around ICT changes the manner in which generation is
sorted out and information shared. ICT offers adaptability of reality, a way out of
confinement, and a conceivably expanded access to learning and beneficial assets even in
remote areas. Be that as it may, ICT may likewise add to segregation and fortify existing
disparities. As all parts of human communication ICT are gendered. Today the hole, the
"digital divide", among ladies and men with respect to access to ICT, and difficulties when
utilizing the equivalent is self-evident. The entrance to, substance and utilization of ICT are
associated with sex standards and imbalances, as well as to endeavours addressing and
evolving these. ICT can possibly reduce a portion of the boundaries looked by ladies. This
incorporates lack of education, neediness, time shortage, obstacles of portability and social
and religious taboos. ICT additionally have the capability of giving apparatuses that may
break limitations on voice, especially open voice, and social control including observation of
ladies' physical and social portability. Access to ICT can expand women and girls' entrance to

the open space, and reinforce their open just as a private office. It tends to be an especially
compelling device to achieve gatherings of women and girls who for various reasons are not
taking an interest out in the open or public activity. women everywhere throughout the world
are progressively swinging to the web practice their political and social rights. Access to ICT
is urgent for women and girls to have the capacity to take an interest in the public arena on
equivalent terms with men and boys. There is a developing acknowledgment of the need to
discuss human rights as a rule and ladies' rights specifically as being significantly
disconnected yet in addition on the web. The first UN-report to make reference to human
rights' pertinence on the web is from 2000, and from there on the UN has progressively
featured the associations among web and human rights. Sweden has led the pack in the work
on the two goals that affirm human rights to be connected online as they are disconnected.
These goals, 20/8 and 26/13, both received with an agreement, structure a significant base for
further work and discourse on human rights and ICT. In such procedures, a sexual orientation
point of view is key. <br><br>

<b>ICT and New media (act as associative as well as dissociative force)</b><br>
It is the point of this collection to define the learning potential characteristic in media and
ICT, both inside and outside regulated learning contexts. Media and ICT have in the previous
decades been set immovably on the educational agenda and will keep on keeping up this
position, not least as impetuses for educational change. Digitalization, intuitiveness,
virtuality, inescapable computing, and versatile advancements present new conceivable
outcomes for learning and expand the spacial and fleeting breaking points of how education
can be sorted out. At the same time, late present-day society is progressively being marked
the 'knowledge society'. In the Industrial Age, the key move was the change of raw materials
into modern items. In the Knowledge Society, we move from production by and by to
creation arranging, and learning is a very important commodity, regardless of whether it is
singular information or authoritative knowledge. The Knowledge Society is, in this manner,
characterized by a continuous production of information, which is an incorporated piece of,
and an essential for, that society's proceeded with presence. The change from an Industrial
Society to a Knowledge Society thus creates a progression of changes in tutoring and the
instructive framework, as exemplified by new necessities to capabilities and competencies.
Competence improvement in the fields of ICT and media is only one case of the new political
demands put on our schools. From one perspective improvements in media and ICT along
these lines recommend that digital communication is of developing importance for learning,
then again this development is reflected in a journey for instructive speculations and
methodologies that can fulfill the new needs for learning and educating started by the
Knowledge Society. In continuation of this, the foundation of a knowledge base in the field
of learning with media and ICT can be viewed as a fundamental task for contemporary and
future research in the field. The present advancements in the field of ICT and media require

an expansive scholarly viewpoint. In this way, it has been a focal worry of the exploration
program to unite and creates distinctive scholastic conventions that have once in the past been
discrete so as to influence them to connect and create in multidisciplinary and
transdisciplinary headings. In the treasury, these diverse research conventions are displayed
and utilized as leeway, for example as a reason for representing new ideas, hypotheses, and
techniques. The multi-and transdisciplinary viewpoint is likewise reflected in the learning
speculations of the articles, which depend on constructivist, arranged and frameworks
hypotheses that in different ways identified with shared information, working environment
learning, communitarian learning, and virtual learning networks. The treasury's attention on
the learning potential characteristic in ICT and media mirrors the significance of the everyday
work of the examination program and the needs that have so far been considered as focal.
Long range interpersonal communication through sites like Facebook and Twitter is changing
the manner in which clients and organizations collaborate. And the manner in which we
behave through our online networking accounts is an immediate reflection on our business.<br>
There are few things one should follow while working on social media like - Round out your
online profiles totally with data about you and your business, utilize an alternate profile or
record for your own associations, make a segment on your primary profile enumerating your
identity trying to become a close acquaintance with and ask that guests maintain that
information, respect information, and values, pick a name that represents the company, etc.<br>

                                                            Media keeps an eye on every work, action to be taken by government.
                                                            Every small action of government in a democracy can’t be unseen or
                                                            noticed by media. Our generation believe in media, depend on media and
                                                            we think that we are getting a good picture of our society. We completely
                                                            depend on media for the truth of our society. There are many incidents
                                                            which we can focus. A lots of scam we see, a lots of reporting we see and
                                                            then we believe that reporting is completely right. We do not dig into that
                                                            reporting. The day if it is trending somehow then we start thinking about the
                                                            content. For example, if we consider about the IPL scandal or deal
                                                            structure of IPL 2013, we are not aware of what exactly happen with that
                                                            match between Rajasthan Royals &amp; Chennai super king in IPL 2013 in

                                                            anything bad with that ball. Till that day, we don’t know the exact details
                                                            about this information. I just have a simple question, as an independent
                                                            watchdog media, why we are not getting a clear picture of anything “The
                                                            truth”? Somewhere our media society is falling. We can take any scam or
                                                            scandal and we are going to find the similar things; this is what happening
                                                            with our media. We have a lots of controversies about indo china border.
                                                            When was the last time some media reporter visited in that area and they
                                                            tell the truth about what exactly happening? After 72 years of
                                                            independence, we are almost at the same place. Earlier we fear about the
                                                            English government and now we fear about the government we choose,
                                                            this is how media doing today. If this is the path our media, then definitely it
                                                            would be difficult for our country which is still initial phase of development.
                                                            If we consider about china, the political bloggers take role of watchdogs of
                                                            power so seriously even if many of them are communist party supporters.
                                                            Changes and challenges of our watchdog journalism tells that “it can be
                                                            possible to generate watchdogging ethos over time and that will depend
                                                            upon our consumer appetite”. I agree that journalism schools and our press

                                                            investigative skills and standard to continue building our media as a

                                                            Most of the proponent think that media as a watch dog will help in removing
                                                            corruptions, exposing wrong doing but in today, due to political pressures
                                                            this is not happening and their opinion is like yes media can change public
                                                            attitude but media cannot mobilize public to participate in political life.
                                                            Today the press is more sensitive how the media reporting to them. After
                                                            
                                                            all I can say that watchdog reporting may lead to reform if we do not have a
                                                            political pressure and this role of our media is important for our democratic
                                                            transition when the media are still supporting government and helping to
                                                            construct the rules and regulations for our officials&quot;. No doubt today media
                                                            is competing with TRPs with other market media just because they want to
                                                            gain more revenue. The media should be like a bridge between our
                                                            defence force and society, our government and society. It’s the age of
                                                            technology too and our media reports should have the same kind of
                                                            knowledge. Media has got the freedom of press in our democracy and this
                                                            means that media is free to report and publicize. We even can’t imagine
                                                            about the democracy about the proper media sources. As we all know,
                                                            Media is being considered as a fourth pillar of democracy after executive,
                                                            legislature, and judiciary and it is fundamental unit to know what is
                                                            happening all over the worlds. Beyond the control and limitations of
                                                            governments, media sometimes raise over and above. In new
                                                            democracies, the idea of media as the eye of public. The sign of strong
                                                            democracy depends how free the media is. The idea should be keep media
                                                            independent so that it can report news without fears. I think media itself
                                                            should be supposed to be like watchdog. Its role is to be aware the people
                                                            about what happening in their society. There was only print media in old
                                                            days and very few reporters around. Most of them were authentic and
                                                            responsible. The sudden rise of TV media created a huge demand of
                                                            journalist. Today we can see a lot of youngster come near camera without
                                                            knowing proper news. Each news channel has some different agendas.
                                                            That’s why they these news channels are turning into view channel. I think
                                                            media too need some penal code. If there is rule and regulation for a
                                                            common man, why not for a media. Any false reporting should be
                                                            punishable too. Today most of the media is being controlled by global
                                                            players like government. There motive is not to spread news and educate
                                                            people. They are something like selling their self. They highlight their party
                                                            news mostly rather than telecasting the social causes and things done by
                                                            other party. Here our media is lagging. This should not happen. My opinion
                                                            is not about the whole media. Still there are some media who really doing
                                                            great as watchdog. Media also aware about the social causes, rights and
                                                            privilege to us criticize. They also aware us about women rights like no
                                                            police can arrest any women after 6 Pm. In democratic country people
                                                            depends on media to select their candidate in elections. It is also an
                                                            important organ during natural disaster. Media is awaring us and only few
                                                            channels is meeting the expected standards but due to some media
                                                            sources the whole media reputations is getting down.<br>
                                                            Media is a great source of information’s, ideas and opinion. It is the
                                                            strongest medium to connect the people. This is the only source which
                                                            cover every religion. If they do not show the right information to people,
                                                            obviously it would affect our country and citizens. I understand that a
                                                            successful democracy could only be said when the media is neutral and
                                                            free from all political pressures. Yes, it would be a sensitive reporting if
                                                            nation come first but still we deserve the truth, the truth about our
                                                            government, the truth about our society, the truth about our soldiers and
                                                            the truth about our politicians.<br></p>

                                                              covertly influencing the way media coverage is done and ensuing perceptions are generated on
                                                              the region and its people. The region’s media organizations are found entrapped amidst a
                                                              number of political, security, military and administrative barricades and region-specific policy
                                                              decisions. The situation resulted in a variety of contrasting interpretations, often bordering on
                                                              describing the northeast Indian media as playground for generating stereotypes and under reporting development.<br/>
                                                              The Indian media network is well connected to ground zero of the NE. News agencies like
                                                              PTI, ANI & IANS has an extensive network of reporters and photographers covering parts of
                                                              NE. They also have a base of freelancers who feed them with news like other parts of India.
                                                              Print Media organisations mostly depend on news feed from these agencies for quite a
                                                              significant portion of their print spaces. The TV news network work in a slightly different way.
                                                              They get video bytes from these news agencies and also have tie-up with local news channels
                                                              for exclusives. News18 has a subsidiary based in Guwahati as News18 Assam NE which
                                                              broadcasts in Assamese and English. Republic TV has a tie up with NewsLive.<br/>
                                                              So, almost all news small or big from NE do reach the news editors at the big news houses.
                                                              But they choose to ignore them. <br/>
                                                              When any news reaches the desk of an editor, he has to make a few decisions which depends
                                                              of a number of things, most importantly the size of impact, the importance of the item,
                                                              recurrence and the audience. Let’s explore them one by one.<br/>
                                                              1. The size of impact: If suppose the news is something that has caused immense impact,
                                                              it will definitely make the cut. Like suppose a train accident with heavy casualties or
                                                              a militant attack.<br/>
                                                              2. Reccurnce: If it’s a recurring event, it tends to loose news space. Like floods in Assam
                                                              get very small attention because it’s recurring event.<br/>
                                                              3. The importance of the news item: How important is the news in terms of National
                                                              interests is another aspect. The last Assam assembly election was widely covered by
                                                              the Indian Media not because it has started to give space to NE but because Ground
                                                              reports suggested that this election might mark the inroads of the BJP into NE.<br/>
                                                              4. The Audience: This is the most important factor. And this defines the business of a
                                                              Media house. So, the editors will have to toe the promoters lines and keep their
                                                              readers and audiences happy. Republic TV keeps reading news about Pakistan or
                                                              against the Congress because that is exactly that their viewers want to see. NDTV
                                                              keeps critisizing Modi.<br/>
                                                              The more important reason for N-E not getting attention in media is the majoritarian
                                                              democracy of India. In a democratic society, where every vote counts, communities with more
                                                              numerical strength and unity find their voice heard whereas communities with fractured
                                                              opinion and less numerical strength often find it difficult to get heard. N-E is less populous
                                                              than the states in Gangetic plains like Bihar and Utter Pradesh thus have less representation inparliament which means lesser say in decision-making at the centre. The another reason is the
                                                              economic and territorial isolation of N-E from mainland India. The well know chicken neck
                                                              corridor is the only strip of land that connects India with its North Eastern states.<br>
                                                              People from Northeast are not satisfied with the way media covers them. They believe that
                                                              Northeast is only covered during insurgencies and very less importance is given to cultural,

                                                              positive reporting like the stories on the beauty of Kashmir never arises. However, the reach
                                                              of media even during insurgencies is very late.<br>

                                                          <p>The Naga-Manipuri embroil related to the entry of NSCN (1M) Gen Secy Muivah into
                                                              Manipur resulting in the ongoing blockade of NH-39 lasted for about two months. This
                                                              economic blockade had a delayed appearance
                                                              in the mainstream media. Had the media
                                                              reported on it earlier this blockade would not
                                                              have lasted two months. The question that
                                                              arises here is, had this kind of blockade
                                                              happened in other regions of India would it
                                                              have lasted for so long and would the media be
                                                              lethargic to report that too? In fact, research
                                                              shows that such kind of blockades for example
                                                              the Telangana hunger strike by the TRS party
                                                              was instantaneously reported by the media and
                                                              continued to do so till it ended.

                                                              This level of
                                                              reporting forced the central government to step in and constitute a committee to look into the demands of the activists as well as resolve the
                                                              matter within a month. Most national newspapers have local editions but here again the
                                                              difference is immense. Local news covers just 2-3 pages of the edition. The rest of the edition
                                                              is from across the country on various topics such as political, cultural or crime. Here again
                                                              news from Northeast is a rarity. Consistently greater coverage to other regions is prevalent.<br>
                                                              A case in point stated by the writer is Manipur which has seen many a new developments and
                                                              incidents in recent times but has still been unable to garner any space on the national media.
                                                              Fashion shows, companies announcing their quarterly and annual results, job placements in
                                                              the llMs, cricket matches, Bollywood films and film stars’ romances are regular stories on the
                                                              national media. In fact, these incidents as brought forth by the writer are happening on a regular
                                                              basis but the media seems to be content in covering the same repeatedly without bringing forth
                                                              any new angles to a story.<br>
                                                              In reality the trend in media is quite disturbing. While every hunger protest for Telangana gets
                                                              mass coverage till the matter is resolved, not many know of from Chanu Shramila or the
                                                              activists in Sikkim who keep on fighting peacefully for the government to take note of their
                                                              reservation on the hydel power project at Lepcha reserve of Dzongu. In the absence of interest
                                                              on part of the mainstream media, people from Northeast India rely on the Internet to share and
                                                              learn about their states. Online forums, social networking, blogs are the main platforms that
                                                              are used. Apart from these, talent shows on television like reality shows, Cultural programs,Northeast fests in various cities, Northeast handicraft exhibitions, sports, theatre and art shows
                                                              are used by the people of Northeast to create awareness about their states.<br>
                                                              One phenomenon that was observed that, the Northeast people wrote 'we' or 'us' when they
                                                              addressed themselves and they wrote 'them' or 'they' for rest of the people from India. This
                                                              may also indicate that the Northeast people think of fellow Indians as others and not one among
                                                              them. This may not only be because of their physical features but also depicts the level of
                                                              importance they are given in the country. Thus leading to alienation and also raising the
                                                              potentiality for the birth of identity crises. Indian media from its very roots has always been
                                                              actively involved and in instances has been made to involve as a platform for not just providing
                                                              information to the public but also as a forum for making the voice of the public reach those in
                                                              power. Be it for the 200 years of colonialism or the long standing aspiration of being a
                                                              developed country to that of the geographic diversities and distance, media in India has served
                                                              as a unifying force as well as an equalizer of power. Today media is considered to be one of
                                                              the most powerful weapons that can bring drastic changes in the economy of the country, only
                                                              if used in a proper way. It is time that media should contribute to the development of Northeast
                                                              region, educate the common people, widening their thoughts and show that even the
                                                              Northeastern states are very much a part of India.<br>
                                                              I do believe the situation is changing rapidly, and that we can expect the North-Easteaners to
                                                              truly be seen as fellow countrymen who are actually doing right what the rest of India is doing
